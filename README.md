Abstract

Executive dysfunction, also known as executive functioning disorder, is a behavioral symptom that inhibits people’s abilities to manage their own thoughts, emotions, and actions. Some of the major effects of executive dysfunction are shown in an individual's ability to plan a schedule and complete tasks. Executive functioning disorder presents a huge problem for workers and students and can have consequences ranging from poor grades to a low credit rating. It derails learning, a sense of accomplishment, collaboration, and many other opportunities, ultimately making it harder for people to contribute their ideas to the world. Our app Omnis aims to help students and workers suffering from executive dysfunction with planning and task execution.
Executive dysfunction often prevents people from creating effective schedules. Sufferers also have difficulty transitioning and focusing on tasks. Luckily, machines can help. Omnis schedules a user’s tasks through algorithms based on proven productivity theories and presents this schedule in the form of a calendar. We also help users identify and redirect from their unproductive behaviors through an explanation of why tasks are scheduled the way they are, taking inspiration from companies like Noom.

There are already many task management apps, but all of them are made for neurotypical people, with little consideration for accessibility. Their customizability makes them overly complicated and they require background knowledge of scheduling theory to be most useful. On the other hand, our platform is tailored to people with executive functioning disorder. Our software is more structured than other task management tools like Workflowy or Clickup. Those platforms are simply places where people go to document tasks. On the other hand, we structure the user’s day, send them notifications, and block their time using the Pomodoro method — we’re a one-stop shop for productivity. 

This app was created for the 2023 Rhode Island Science Fair.
